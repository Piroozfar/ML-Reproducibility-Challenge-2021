# ML-Reproducibility-Challenge-2021
In this research, we have tried to reproduce the results and achievements of this article, and this was done with the help of codes provided by the author, and in this article, we have tried to investigate the effects of fine-tuning operations on the Geometry of Embedding Space. This is done by measuring a criterion called isotropy as well as the Spearman correlation criterion.
The Spearman correlation criterion examines the performance of models in Semantic textual similarity task, which is characterized by numbers between 0 and 5.
In this work, transformer-based models called Bert and Roberta are used, which are used in two modes, pre-trained or fine-tuned, for the STS task.
